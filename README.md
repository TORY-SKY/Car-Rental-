Project Structure:

app.py: The main Flask application file containing routes, logic for handling form submissions, and database interaction (placeholder for implementation).
forms.py: Defines Flask-WTF forms for user registration, login, and potentially car rental booking (not included in this example).
templates: Contains HTML templates for different pages of the website, including registration, login, and potentially car search/booking (not included in this example).
static: Stores static files like CSS for styling the website.
Dependencies:

Flask
Flask-WTF
Jinja2 (usually included with Flask)
Additional libraries for database interaction (e.g., SQLAlchemy) and potentially payment processing (if applicable)
Running the Application:

Install the required dependencies:

Bash
pip install Flask Flask-WTF


(Install additional dependencies for database and payment processing as needed)

Set up your database connection details (if applicable) in app.py.

Run the application:

Bash
python app.py

This will typically start a development server, accessible by default at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

Deployment:

For production deployment, you'll need to choose a suitable hosting environment and configure it to serve your Flask application. This might involve using a WSGI server like Gunicorn and a web server like Nginx or Apache.

Features (Implemented):

User registration with basic validation (username, email, password, confirm password).
User login (placeholder for authentication logic).
CSRF protection using Flask-WTF.
Features (Not Included in this Example):

Car search and booking functionality.
Password reset feature.
Payment processing integration (if applicable).
Security Considerations:

This is a basic example and does not cover all security aspects of a real-world application.
Implement strong password hashing using a secure algorithm like bcrypt to protect user passwords.
Use database access controls and input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
Consider reCAPTCHA integration for forms to mitigate automated bot attacks.
Further Development:

Implement car search and booking functionality with proper database interaction.
Integrate payment processing for secure online payments.
Enhance the user interface with styling and interactive elements.
Implement additional features like rental history, account management, and vehicle management (if applicable for an admin panel).
